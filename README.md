[![Documentation Status](https://app.readthedocs.org/projects/kilomatch/badge/)](https://kilomatch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

A MATLAB toolbox for tracking the neurons across days.

Check out the Python version of Kilomatch [here](https://github.com/jiumao2/pyKilomatch)!  

Read the [documentation](https://kilomatch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more details.

## Installation

To install Kilomatch, follow these steps:

- Download the code from the [Kilomatch](https://github.com/jiumao2/Kilomatch)

- Development is based on MATLAB R2022b. The following toolboxes are required:

    - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
    -   Optimization Toolbox
    -   Parallel Computing Toolbox

- Python 3.9 \~ 3.11 with `scikit-learn` and `hdbscan` packages installed ([Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) recommended).

```python
conda create -n hdbscan python=3.10
conda activate hdbscan
pip install scikit-learn
pip install hdbscan
```

- Specify the Python executable path in `settings.json`

```json
"path_to_python": "path_to_anaconda\\anaconda3\\envs\\hdbscan\\python.exe"
```

You can get the path by running the following command in the Anaconda prompt:

```bash
conda info --envs
```

## How to use it

Please follow the [tutorial](https://kilomatch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorials.html) to run your dataset.  

Please raise an issue if you meet any bugs or have any questions. We are looking forward to your feedback!

Performs DBSCAN over varying epsilon values and integrates the result to find a clustering that gives the best stability over epsilon. This allows HDBSCAN to find clusters of varying densities (unlike DBSCAN), and be more robust to parameter selection.
